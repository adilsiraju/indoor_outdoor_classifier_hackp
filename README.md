# Indoor/Outdoor Image Classifier

This project is a simple image classification pipeline to distinguish between indoor and outdoor scenes using deep learning. It uses **FastAI** and a small custom dataset, with images downloaded from Bing. The workflow includes data collection, cleaning, model training, and evaluation.  

ðŸš€ **With just 60 training images, the model achieved 91% accuracy.**

## Live Demo

This project is published on GitHub Pages:  
ðŸ‘‰ [GitHub Pages Demo](https://adilsiraju.github.io/indoor_outdoor_classifier_hackp/)  

It uses Jekyll themes for a clean and modern look.  

## Hugging Face Spaces

The classifier is also deployed on Hugging Face Spaces:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/adilsiraju/Indoor_outdoor_classifier)  

The GitHub Pages site uses the Hugging Face API for live predictions.  

## Features
- Downloads images for 'Indoor' and 'Outdoor' classes using Bing Images  
- Cleans and verifies images  
- Trains a ResNet-based classifier using FastAI  
- Achieved **91% accuracy with just 60 training images**  
- Evaluates model performance with confusion matrix and top losses  

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastai bing_image_downloader ddgs fastdownload
   ```
3. Run the notebook `indoor_outdoor_classifier.ipynb` step by step.
4. Optionally, add more images to `area_types/Indoor` and `area_types/Outdoor` for better results.
